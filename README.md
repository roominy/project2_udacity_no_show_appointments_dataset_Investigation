Udacity no show appointments dataset Investigation

In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated findings about it. I used  Python 
libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib where I've gone through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
The dataset I choise is "No-show appointments" dataset.
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or 
not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
